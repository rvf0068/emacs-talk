* Introduction

  I am not a programmer, I am a mathematician that loves using
  software.

  Emacs is one of my favorite pieces of software (together with TeX,
  Python, GAP, Sage and git).

  All of them can be used inside Emacs.

  Besides, there is =org-mode=! Among /many/ other uses, =org-mode=
  can have live blocks of source code in a document.

* Git -> magit

   magit is an Emacs package that provides an interface to git.

   For example, the development of this talk.

* Sage mode

  =sage-shell-mode= is an alternative to the 'official' =sage-mode=.

* GAP mode

  GAP running inside Emacs

* Org mode

  Org mode is an Emacs mode
