* Introduction

  I am not a programmer, I am a mathematician that loves using
  software and has learned some tricks.

  Emacs is one of my favorite pieces of software (together with TeX,
  Python, GAP, Sage and git).

  All of them can be used inside Emacs.

  Besides, there is =org-mode=.

* Git -> magit

   magit is an Emacs package that provides an interface to git.

   For example, the development of this talk.

* Sage mode

  =sage-shell-mode= is an alternative to the 'official' =sage-mode=.

* GAP mode

  GAP running inside Emacs

* Org mode

  Org mode is an Emacs mode

* Python block in org mode

  Hello this is the first

  #+begin_src python :exports both
from random import randint
x=[]
for i in range(5):
    x.append([i,randint(1,20)])
return x
  #+end_src

* matplotlib

  #+begin_src python :results file
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig=plt.figure(figsize=(4.5,3))
plt.plot([0,1,3,2])
plt.savefig('myfig.png')
return 'myfig.png'
  #+end_src
